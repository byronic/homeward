# homeward
A text-based adventure game about family, loss, and being a kid.

## Playing the game
`mvn clean package` builds the game into the `homeward/target` directory.
It packages everything neatly into a `jar-with-dependencies` file.

Use `java -jar homeward/target/homeward-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
to play.

Note that this is still in rapid development and many things are weird.
